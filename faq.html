                    <p>
Established in 2022, we began our journey working with youth at risk and individuals with a history of incarceration. 
                      We have come a long way. From introducing befrienders and animal-assisted activities into our sessions to equipping beneficiaries with skills [in other sectors] that empower them 
                      to contribute positively to the environment, animals, and their communities, we’ve grown to offer even more opportunities, including part-time internships.
<br><br>
Today, our reach has expanded to a diverse range of demographics, including youth-at-risk, stay-at-home moms, seniors, students, and youth in general for skill-building and character development.
                      We also work with preschoolers and students from lower-income communities, ensuring our initiatives create meaningful opportunities for all.
