                    <h2>Do you incorporate live animals in your workshops?</h2>
                    <p>

Yes we do! For animal-assisted interactions and activities, we will have live animals onsite. As the animals are a vital part of our team, we hope that all present are comfortable with their presence in sessions. Animals have subjective experiences, feelings, and triggers. As such, The Good People (TGP) is responsible for their welfare.<br><br>

While considerable efforts have been undertaken to anticipate and mitigate potential behavior, it is important to acknowledge that animals' actions may not always be entirely predictable. External program venues are equipped with sufficient resources to minimize foreseeable incidents and ensure the safety of both humans and animals. <br><br>

Moreover, we take deliberate steps to minimize stressors, thereby reducing any potential discomfort to the animals involved. For a comprehensive understanding of possible risks associated with animal interaction sessions and the corresponding guidelines for participants, click on this <a href="risks&rules" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">link</a> to see the possible risks associated with animal interaction sessions and some rules participants should abide by to reduce the aforementioned risks. This list is non-exhaustive.

                    <h2>How do you protect the welfare of the animals involved in your sessions?</h2>
                    <p>

The welfare of our animals is our top priority. We adhere to strict guidelines and standards to ensure they are well-cared-for, healthy, and comfortable in their roles. <br><br> 
                      Our animals undergo regular health check-ups, vaccinations, and receive proper nutrition. We also provide them with a comfortable environment and ample rest between sessions. Our handlers are trained professionals who prioritize the well-being of the animals, and sessions are designed with their welfare in mind.

                    <p>

Absolutely! We prioritize everyone's comfort and well-being. We can discuss any specific concerns or accommodations to ensure a positive experience for everyone.<br><br>
Before each session, we will run through with you and the other participants an indemnity form. Within the indemnity form, kindly disclose any allergies you may have to animals, and we will advise you accordingly.
<br><br>
While we hope to make every activity a fun and enjoyable one, we are dedicated to ensuring that each activity not only provides enjoyment but also prioritizes the well-being of all participants.
