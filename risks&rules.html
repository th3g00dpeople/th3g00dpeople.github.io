            <h2>Rules and Risks</h2>
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Allergies</h3>
                <p>There will be animals in program venues. If you or any participants have allergies to animals or their food (e.g., hay or grass), notify the point of contact (i.e., a representative of the organization) in advance. TGP cannot provide medication for allergies and will not accept liability for allergic reactions during sessions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Animal Behavior</h3>
                <p>Animals have their own natural defenses. While our staff takes measures to prevent injuries, there is still a possibility of scratches or bites. TGP does not accept liability for any injuries occurring during sessions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Animal Welfare</h3>
                <p>For their safety and dignity, our animals are not declawed. While their claws are routinely trimmed, scratches can still occur during play. This is particularly true for cats.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Safety Issues</h3>
                <p>All our animals are screened by a veterinarian before participating in sessions. Although the risk of disease transmission is very low due to the brief nature of interactions, TGP does not accept liability for any infections resulting from the sessions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The animals have individual rights, just as each participant does. Animals will not be forced to participate if they show adverse behavior.</li>
                    <li>Animals will have a designated quiet space (e.g., playpen) where they can rest. Participants must not disturb them while they are in this area.</li>
                    <li>Animals must always be treated gently and never mishandled or mistreated. TGP reserves the right to remove participants who compromise animal welfare.</li>
                    <li>If an animal shows signs of distress, fear, or irritation, they will be removed from the session. Only educators or handlers may interact with animals during these times.</li>
                    <li>Animals will only be carried by an educator or handler unless otherwise stated in the program outline.</li>
                    <li>Participants must keep their voices low in the activity area to avoid causing distress to the animals.</li>
                    <li>No smoking is allowed near the animals.</li>
                    <li>Caregivers of children under 10 may remain on the premises during the childâ€™s session.</li>
                    <li>TGP reserves the right to replace or cancel an animal-assisted activity without notice if an animal is unwell or unavailable.</li>
